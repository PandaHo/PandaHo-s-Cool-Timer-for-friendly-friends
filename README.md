âœ¨ Key Features

This application is packed with features designed to be both powerful and easy to use:

    Multi-Timer Support: Manage up to 8 independent timers simultaneously. Each timer saves its own duration, title, notes, and running state.

    Persistent State: Close the app and re-launch it laterâ€”your running and paused timers will be exactly where you left them!

    Integrated Notes System: Attach notes to any timer! The notes library is a powerful tool for task management:

        Rich Text Editor: Style your notes with Bold, Italics, <u>Underline</u>, different font families, sizes, and custom colors.

        Multiple Completion Types: Create simple text notes, interactive Checkboxes, or track progress with Digital Counters (e.g., [5/10]).

    Customizable Alarms:

        Set custom primary and secondary alarm sounds (.mp3, .wav, .ogg).

        Choose how many times the alarm should loop (or set it to infinite!).

    "Presents" System: Save and load entire sets of 8 timers as .ini file templates. Perfect for switching between different workflows (e.g., "Work Timers" vs. "Hobby Timers").

    Polished Custom UI.

    Cross-Platform: Built with standard libraries, making it compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
